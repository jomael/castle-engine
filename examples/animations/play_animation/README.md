Demo of playing animations using `TCastleSceneCore.PlayAnimation` method
in Castle Game Engine.

You can load any 2D or 3D model (sample 2D and 3D models are available),
see the detected animations inside, and play them.
You can test various PlayAnimation features:
- play forward or backward
- loop or not
- transition (animation blending),
  see https://castle-engine.io/wp/2018/03/21/animation-blending/

For more information about using the `PlayAnimation` method, see the manual
https://castle-engine.io/manual_scene.php ,
section "Play animation".

Note that view3dscene ( https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php )
has "Animations" panel that also allows to test these features.
But the source code of this example application is simpler to follow
than view3dscene.
