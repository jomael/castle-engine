{ Game initialization.

  This code is independent from mobile / standalone platforms.
  It will be used by the appropriate .lpr file for desktop, Android or iOS.

  Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own projects.
  (This code is in public domain, unlike most other CGE code which
  is covered by the LGPL license variant, see the COPYING.txt file.)

{ One-time initialization of resources. }

  Window.Container.LoadSettings('castle-data:/CastleSettings.xml');

  StateMain := TStateMain.Create(Application);
  TUIState.Current := StateMain;
end;

initialization
  { Set ApplicationName early, as our log uses it.
    Optionally you could also set ApplicationProperties.Version here. }
  ApplicationProperties.ApplicationName := 'my_fantastic_game';

  { Start logging. Do this as early as possible,
    to log information and eventual warnings during initialization.

    For programs, InitializeLog is not called here.
    Instead InitializeLog is done by the program main file,
    after command-line parameters are parsed. }
  if IsLibrary then
    InitializeLog;

  { Initialize Application.OnInitialize. }
  Application.OnInitialize := @ApplicationInitialize;

  { Create and assign Application.MainWindow. }
  Window := TCastleWindowBase.Create(Application);
  Application.MainWindow := Window;

  { You should not need to do *anything* more in the unit "initialization" section.
    Most of your game initialization should happen inside ApplicationInitialize.
    In particular, it is not allowed to read files before ApplicationInitialize
    (in case of non-desktop platforms, some necessary may not be prepared yet). }
