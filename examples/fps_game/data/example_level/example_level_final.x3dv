# This file defines the complete 3D model of the level.
#
# - The basic level geometry is exported from Blender, as 2 glTF files
#   (example_level.gltf and water.gltf).
#   They are used (by "Inline" node) here.
# - This file also adds some additional nodes,
#   to define information that cannot be expressed in Blender.
#
# We use X3D nodes, writing them in "classic encoding" in this file.
# See https://castle-engine.io/vrml_x3d.php for information about X3D nodes.

# You can embed one 3D file within another using the "Inline" node,
# this way example_level_final.x3dv contains
# the example_level.gltf (generated by Blender) + some of our customizations.
Inline { url "example_level.gltf" }

# TODO: We include this only because for now we don't read lights from glTF file.
# The example_level_lights.x3d was generated by Blender -> X3D exporter long time ago.

  # avatarSize is a list of floats:
  #
  # - collision sphere radius (Camera.Radius in our engine).
  #   If this is not specified (or zero), we will automatically calculate
  #   something hopefully sensible based on level size.
  #
  # - height above the terrain, used only when gravity works
  #   (Camera.PreferredHeight in our engine).
  #   If this is not specified, we will automatically calculate it based
  #   on Camera.Radius, and we always correct it (as this must be > Camera.Radius
  #   for things to work sensibly, preferably > Camera.Radius * 2 to also work
  #   with crouching, head bobbing etc.)
  #
  # - (not specified here) tallest object that you can climb, like a stair step
  #   (Camera.ClimbHeight in our engine).
  #   If not specified (or zero), there is no such limit, and you can climb
  #   very steep (but not vertical) slopes.

  # speed is in units per second. This is Camera.MoveSpeed in our engine.

# Viewpoint defines initial player position/orientation when starting the level.
# I usually define it by navigating in view3dscene and then using view3dscene
# "Console -> Print Current Camera (Viewpoint) (VRML 2.0, X3D classic)".
# But you could also define it by setting camera in Blender
# (make sure in this case that you copy the Viewpoint node to this file,
# as bindable nodes like Viewpoint/NavigationInfo are ignored in Inline files).
#
# Generated by view3dscene.
# Use view3dscene "Clipboard -> Print Current Camera..." to generate X3D code like below.
# Camera settings "encoded" in the X3D declaration below :
#   position 16.83 2.07 -3.81
