{ You can enable the scripts inside VRML/X3D 3D model to call a particular
  ObjectPascal function.

  This is one way to enable your 3D models to do something
  that is usually outside the scope (and security) of a normal VRML/X3D browser.
  This way you can enable VRML/X3D models to interact with
  some database, or desktop task, or... well, do anything
  that native ObjectPascal code can do.
  This approach gives the whole control of when the given operation
  is executed to the author of VRML/X3D 3D model. The ObjectPascal code
  only implements and registers methods, that may be then called at any time
  while the VRML/X3D is loaded.

  Inside the VRML/X3D model, this is declared by "compiled:" protocol
  inside a Script node. See data/compiled_script_tests.x3dv.
  See https://castle-engine.io/x3d_extensions.php#section_ext_script_compiled
  for more information. }
