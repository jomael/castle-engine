{ Example how to animate (change, modify) the 3D model (it's VRML/X3D graph)
  using ObjectPascal code.
  Run this program without any parameters in this directory
  (it opens file "data/boxes.x3dv") and watch the trivial animation.
  You can rotate/move the scene by dragging with mouse,
  see view3dscene docs (we use the same "Examine" camera).

  For programmers:

  Generally, you just change VRML/X3D graph (rooted in Scene.RootNode)
  however you like, whenever you like. TX3DNode class has a lot of methods
  to find and change nodes within the graph, you can insert/delete/change
  any of their children nodes, fields, and generally do everything.
  Remember to call "Changed" on every changed field (or change it only
  by Send methods, see more info on
  [https://castle-engine.io/vrml_engine_doc/output/xsl/html/section.scene.html#section.scene_caching].)

  Of course, in case of trivial animation in this program, we could
  also express it directly in VRML/X3D and just load the scene,
  setting Scene.ProcessEvents := true. This would make the scene "animate itself",
  without the need for any ObjectPascal code to do this. But, for example sake,
  we animate it here by our own code.
