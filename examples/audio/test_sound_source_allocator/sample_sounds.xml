<!--
   This is a sample sounds.xml file, usable by TXmlSoundEngine class.
   Configuration of game sounds. Each sound has a <sound> element.
   You can add here sounds, and reference them from other configuration
   files (e.g. creature config file will allow you to connect
   sound names to creature actions like attack, death etc.).

   `name' is the unique sound name. Each <sound> element must have a different
   name.

   `url' attribute defaults to `name' + '.wav', so in the most
   common situation, when sound named xxx has the filename xxx.wav,
   you don't have to specify this. You have to specify url
   only if the sound needs different url (for whatever reason),
   or when the sound currently has no url (which means that it will
   not be ever played). In the last case, you should set url to
   empty string, i.e. url="".

   Note that url can be relative to the location of this XML file.
   In the simple case, you can just place this XML file in the same directory
   as your sounds.

   `gain', `min_gain', `max_gain' set loudness.
   By default (if not specified) gain is 1, min/max are 0/1.

   `default_importance' is the sound importance, for AL sound manager.
   You can place here a simple unsigned int value, but it's strongly advised
   to use one of predefined special values, like "max".
   For "The Castle": more predefined importances are
   "player" or "default_creature" or "level_event".

   For more details see declaration of TSoundInfo.

   Comments for "The Castle" only:
   Note that you can change this file while the game is running,
   and reload it by "Reload sounds/index.xml" command from the debug menu.
   This allows you to easily test various sound settings without
   restarting the actual game program. Changes may only be reflected
   in newly started sounds, not in currently played sounds.

<sounds>
  <!-- Example simplest sound entry. -->
  <sound name="sound1" />

  <!-- Example sound with some non-default attributes. -->
  <sound name="player_pick_item"
    gain="0.5" min_gain="0" max_gain="1" default_importance="max"/>

  <!-- Example sounds that have non-standard filename (i.e. filename
       is not simply the sound name + '.wav' extension). -->
  <sound name="player_lava_pain" url="doom/dsplpain.wav" />
  <sound name="intro_music" url="intro_music.ogg" />

  <!-- Example sound that has explicit empty url, to indicate
       that the sound doesn't exist actually.
       Such sound can be treated as usual by your program using
       XmlSoundEngine unit, you can pass it to Sound or Sound3d
       methods without errors etc., but the sound will actually not play.

       This is useful if you plan to use the sound in the game,
       but you don't have actually the sound data (WAV file etc.)
       prepared yet. Then you can write such sound with empty
       url and use it everywhere like it would exist.

       Later, when someone will add the actual WAV file, you just
       fill url below and everything works.  -->
  <sound name="player_footsteps_watery" url="" />
