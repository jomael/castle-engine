  { Wait enough time to finish playing. (because PlaySound above doesn't block).
    In this simple program, we just sleep enough time
    to finish playing sound, with some margin. Alternative, more precise way
    to do this would be query is sound playing (call SoundEngine.Refresh
    from time to time, and watch out for TSound.OnRelease event;
    PlaySound returns TSound instance for such purposes). }
