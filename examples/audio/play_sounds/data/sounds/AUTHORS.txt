The sound files here have been converted by SOX into various formats/sampling rates,
to test that CastleSoundEngine can play various combinations OK.
Some of these conversions degrade sound file quality,
e.g. I made some sounds mono or decrease their frequency.
Again, this is just to test that these sounds work.

If you want to use these sounds in your own games,
follow the links above to download the files in original quality.
Or see inside original_versions/ subdirectory.
