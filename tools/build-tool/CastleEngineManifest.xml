        Important on Windows, but defined everywhere for consistency.
        This avoids the build tool locking DLL files of a project,
        when it is run inside the project's directory.
        This would prevent compile/clean options from removing/overwriting
        the DLL files.

        Since build tool right now doesn't actually need Zlib, Libpng, OpenAL
        libraries (but it would load them otherwise) this is a simple solution.
