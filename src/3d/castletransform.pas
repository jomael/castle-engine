      It is usually simpler to call @link(TCastleViewport.PrepareResources)
      then this method. Calling @code(Viewport.PrepareResources(MyScene))
      will automatically call @code(MyScene.PrepareResources(...)) underneath,
      with proper parameters.

      It is best to call this when the rendering context is initailized,
      e.g. at Application.OnInitialize or later.
      Calling this method before the rendering context is initialized
      (e.g. from initializaton section of some unit)
      will have to skip some preparations, thus reducing the effectiveness of this method.

      This makes sure that appropriate methods execute as fast as possible.
      It's never required to call this method
      --- everything will be prepared "as needed" anyway.
      But if you allow everything to be prepared "as needed",
      then e.g. the first @link(Render) call may take a long time because it may
      have to prepare resources that will be reused in next @link(Render) calls.
      This may make your program seem slow at the beginning
      (when rendering resources are being prepared, so at the first frame,
      or a couple of first animation frames). To avoid this, call this method,
      showing the user something like "now we're preparing
      the resources --- please wait".

      @param(Options What features should be prepared to execute fast.

          left mouse button) is pressed or released (depending on Active parameter).

          Note that the exact key or mouse responsible for this is configurable
          in our engine by Input_Interact. By default it's the left mouse button,
          as is usual for VRML/X3D browsers. But it can be configured to be other
          mouse button or a key, for example most 3D games use "e" key to interact.

          In case of Active = @false (which means that pointing device
          is no longer pressed), an extra parameter CancelAction indicates
          whether this pointing device "press and release" sequence may be
          considered a "click". When CancelAction = @true, then you should not make
          a "click" event (e.g. TouchSensor should not send touchTime event etc.).

          In case of Active = @true, CancelAction is always @false.
        )

        @item(PointingDeviceMove signals that pointer moves over this 3D object.)
      )

      PointingDeviceMove receives Pick information about what exactly is hit
      by the 3D ray corresponding to the current mouse position.
      It contains the detailed information about 3D point, triangle
      and ray (all in local coordinate system) that are indicated by the mouse.
      PointingDeviceActivate does not receive this information now
      (because it may happen in obscure situations when ray direction is not known;
      this is all related to our "fallback to MainScene" mechanism).

      They also receive Distance to the collision,
      in world coordinates. See TRayCollision.Distance.

      The pointing device event (activation,
      deactivation or move) is send first to the innermost 3D object.
      That is, we first send this event to the first item on
      TRayCollision list corresponding to the current ray.
      This way, the innermost ("most local") 3D object has the chance
      to handle this event first. If the event is not handled, it is passed
      to other 3D objects (we simply iterate over the TRayCollision list).
      If nothing on TRayCollision list
      handled the item, it is eventually passed to main 3D scene
      (TCastleRootTransform.MainScene), if it wasn't already present on
      TRayCollision list.

      Note that when passing this event to TCastleRootTransform.MainScene,
      it is possible that 3D ray simply didn't hit anything (mouse pointer
      is over the background). In this case, TRayCollisionNode.Point
      is undefined, TRayCollisionNode.Triangle is @nil
      and Distance is MaxSingle.

      This event should be handled only if GetExists.
      Usually, 3D objects with GetExists = @false will not be returned
      by RayCollision, so they will not receive this event anyway.
      However, if 3D object may be equal to TCastleRootTransform.MainScene,
      then it should be secured and check for GetExists
      inside PointingDeviceActivate and PointingDeviceMove.

    { Middle point, usually "eye point", of the 3D model.
      This is used for sphere center (if overriden Sphere returns @true)
      and is the central point from which collisions of this object
      are checked (Move, MoveAllowed, Height, LineOfSight).
      For 3D things like level scene this is mostly useless (as you will leave
      Sphere at default @false then, and the scene itself doesn't move),
      but it's crucial for dynamic 3D things like player and moving creatures.

      In short, it's usually most comfortable to think about this as
      a position of the eye, or the middle of the creature's head.

      In an ideal situation, it should not be based on anything dynamic.
      For example, when this is based on the current bounding box of the animation,
      there is a risk that a large and sudden change in animation
      box could make the Middle point to jump to the other side of
      the wall (breaking collisions, as it changes Middle without a chance
      to check for collisions by MoveAllowed).
      Ideally, it should remain constant even when the shape of the object changes,
      and be possible to change only when MoveAllowed is checked
      (so only when @link(TCastleTransform.Translation) can change).

      bounding sphere around the object), and it may be used for some
      collisions instead of BoundingBox.
      See @link(CollidesWithMoving) and @link(MoveAllowed) for when it may happen.

        @item(It can have constant radius, even though the actual
          creature animates. This allows us to perfectly, reliably guarantee
          that sphere absolutely never collides with level and such.

          In case of a tight bounding volume (box or sphere) that animates,
          this guarantee is not really possible. Simply increasing time changes
          the animation to the next frame, which may be slightly larger
          in one dimension because e.g. creature moves a hand in this direction.
          This means that simply increasing time may change the non-collidable
          creature into a collidable one, if creature stands close to a wall/other
          creature and such. And we cannot simply stop/reverse an arbitrary animation
          at an arbitrary time (to avoid collision), this would look weird
          for some animations and would require some additional work
          at preparing animations and designing AI (as then "every action can
          be interrupted").

          Also using a bounding volume large enough to account for all
          possible positions is not doable, as it would be too large.
          Consider that for humanoid creatures, walking animation usually
          has tall and thin bounding box (creature stands) but dead/lying animation
          usually has flat and wide bounding box.

          So, only a bounding volume (like a sphere) that
          @italic(may be smaller than bounding volume) can remain constant
          and easily guarantee the assertion "it never collides".

          This means that using such sphere results in simpler collision
          detection routines, as they may assume that collision doesn't occur.
          In contrast, detection routines looking at our (possibly animated)
          BoundingBox must take into account that collision may already be happening,
          and they must incorporate code to allow creatures/players to "get unstruck".)

        @item(Using smaller sphere also allows to naturally ascend the stairs
          and upward slopes. Sphere can move forward slightly, and then creature
          may raise up, to reach it's preferred height. Then sphere can move
          further forward, and so on. This alllows to allow stair climbing
          for creatures without any extra effort in the code.

          The downside is that creature legs will temporarily "sink into the floor"
          when climbing up the stairs. But it's not noticeable if "growing up"
          mechanism works fast enough.)
      )

      Sphere disadvantage:

      @unorderedList(
        @item(Sphere is far from perfect as a bounding volume --- it's too small,
          sometimes also too large, sometimes both at the same time...

          Since the Sphere radius remains always the same, it must be good
          for many creature animation frames. In cases where the sphere
          isn't suitable, and you don't need advantages above --- you can
          make @name return @false.
          E.g. a dead creature may be stuck in a wall,
          and it doesn't have to climb stairs. So you don't really need
          sphere advantages listed above, and @name may return @false
          when creature is in dying state.

          But still it may be a problem sometimes, if some creature states
          have entirely different animations and bounding boxes. Then you
          will be forced to choose one universal Radius for all creature
          states. And you need constant radius to keep the advantage above
          of "guarantee".

          1. Obviously you can't set radius too small, because if it's much smaller
          than actual creature's geometry then the creature will noticeably collide
          with level geometry and other creatures.

          2. On the other hand, you can't set radius too large
          (or move sphere center, Middle, much lower).
          This would block stair climbing.

          When Gravity is @true, then the @italic(bottom) is considered to be
          the plane where World.GravityCoordinate (like Z or Y axis) is zero.
          The actual bottom (lowest point) of the bounding box doesn't matter.
          This means that things placed below zero plane (like a creature tentacle
          or leg) will sink into the ground, instead of causing whole creature
          to move up. It also means that the creature can easily float above
          the ground, just model it a little above the zero plane.

          In other words, this allows you to model the creature
          with respect to the ground (zero plane), which is comfortable.

          Note that setting MiddleHeight to exact 0 means that gravity will not work,
          as it means that the PreferredHeight above the ground
          is to be stuck right at the ground level.

          For gravity to work right, the MiddleHeight should be large enough
          to cause PreferredHeight to be > @link(Sphere) radius,
          for all possible animation states (for all possible bounding box values).

      These properties provide an alternative way to get and set the @link(Rotation)
      of the transformation.
      Thinking in terms of "direction" and "up" is often more natural
      when transforming creatures and player.

      The @link(Orientation) determines what is your default direction and up
      (when the @link(Rotation) is zero).
      By default we follow X3D standard vectors suitable for gravity along
      the Y axis. So direction is -Z (DefaultCameraDirection),
      up is +Y (DefaultCameraUp).

      The @link(Direction) and @link(Up) vectors should always be normalized
      (have length 1). When setting them by these properties, we will normalize
      them automatically.

      They must also always be orthogonal.
      When setting @link(Direction), @link(Up) will always be automatically
      adjusted to be orthogonal to @link(Direction). And vice versa ---
      when setting @link(Up), @link(Direction) will be adjusted.

    { Set at once vectors: position, direction, up.

      ADir and AUp given here do not have to be normalized
      (they will be normalized if needed).
      They will be automatically fixed to be orthogonal, if necessary:
      when AdjustUp = @true (the default) we will adjust the up vector
      (preserving the given direction value),
      otherwise we will adjust the direction (preserving the given up value). }

    { Change up vector, keeping the direction unchanged.
      If necessary, the up vector provided here will be fixed to be orthogonal
      to direction.

      This is similar to assigning @link(Up) vector using it's property setter,
      but different behavior happens when we need to fix vectors to have
      direction orthogonal to up (which must be always true).
      In case of assigning @link(Up) by property setter,
      the @link(Direction) vector is changed (if necessary, to be orthogonal to up).
      In case of this method, the up vector is changed (if necessary,
      to be orthogonal to direction).

      It's good to use this if you have a preferred up vector for creatures,
      but still preserving the direction vector has the highest priority. }

      always you use the same Orientation throughout your game).
      By default it's otUpYDirectionMinusZ (matching default cameras
      of OpenGL and VRML/X3D).

      This value determines how you should model your 3D models,

    { Should this 3D object participate in collision detection.
      You can turn this off, useful to make e.g. "fake" walls
      (to some secret places on level).

      This describes collision resolution with almost everything --- camera,
      player (in third-person perspective, camera may differ from player),
      other creatures. That is because everything
      resolves collisions through our methods MoveCollision and HeightCollision
      (high-level) or SegmentCollision, SphereCollision, SphereCollision2D,
      PointCollision2D, BoxCollision (low-level).

      (Note that RayCollision is excluded from this,
      it exceptionally ignores Collides value, as it's primarily used for picking.
      Same for SegmentCollision with LineOfSight=true.)

      The only exception are the collisions with TCastleMoving instances
      (movable world parts like elevators and doors) that have their own
      detection routines and look at CollidesWithMoving property of other objects.
      That is, the TCastleMoving instance itself must still have Collides = @true,
      but it interacts with @italic(other) objects if and only if they have
      CollidesWithMoving = @true (ignoring their Collides value).
      This allows items to be moved by elevators, but still player and creatures
      can pass through them.

    This is crucial: TCastleTransformList.Notify,

    the List are always valid objects (no invalid references,
    even for a short time). }

  { About List <> nil check:

    How situation with List = nil may happen? When our List is destroyed,
    it calls B.FreeNotification on all it's items, so it (falsely) seems we will
    not get any more notifications.

    It turns out that we may get notifications,
    and they are notifications about our own destruction (AComponent = Self).
    That is because TComponent.Notification passes down the notification to
    all it's FComponents, that is rtl/objpas/classes/compon.inc
    (in FPC sources) contains code

    Procedure TComponent.Notification(AComponent: TComponent; Operation: TOperation);
    begin
      ...
      For Runner:=0 To FComponents.Count-1 do
        TComponent(FComponents.Items[Runner]).Notification(AComponent,Operation);
    end;

    And FComponents contain all components that are owned.
    So we are informed when something is removed from the owner,
    including about our own removal. (And in this case, we are a TCastleTransform descendant
    ourselves, just like our children; so check "AComponent is TCastleTransform" doesn't
    protect us.)
    Practical situation when it happens is in testcases
    TTestCastleTransform.TestNotifications and TTestCastleTransform.TestNotificationsSceneManager. }

  if (Operation = opRemove) and (AComponent is TCastleTransform) and (List <> nil) then
    List.RemoveAll(AComponent);

          AboveHeight - PreferredHeight,

          So actually this is too large MaximumFallingDistance.

          But actually it's OK when Sphere is used, because then wall-sliding
          in MoveCollision can correct new position,
          so actually it will be slightly above the ground. So falling
          down will work.

          But when Sphere is not used, the situation is worse,
          because then MoveCollision doesn't do wall-sliding.
          And it will always simply reject such move
          with MaximumFallingDistance.
          If FPS is low (so we would like to fall down at once
          by large distance), this is noticeable: in such case, instead
          of falling down, creature hangs over the ground,
          because MoveCollision simply doesn't allow it fall
          exactly by AboveHeight - PreferredHeight.
          So MaximumFallingDistance has to be a little smaller in this case.
          In particular, this was noticeable for the initially dead alien
          creature on "Doom" level, when shadows were on (when shadows were on,
          FPS is low, that's why the bug was noticeable only with shadows = on).

          TODO: the better version would be to improve

          workarounding it here with this epsilon.
