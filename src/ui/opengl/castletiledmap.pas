{ Loading and rendering maps created in Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org/).

  In the usual case,
  create @link(TCastleTiledMapControl) and set @link(TCastleTiledMapControl.URL)
  to indicate your Tiled map (TMX file).
  @link(TCastleTiledMapControl) is a standard Castle Game Engine user interface
  control (descendant of @link(TCastleUserInterface)), you can display it
  like any other UI control, you can also design it using CGE Editor.
