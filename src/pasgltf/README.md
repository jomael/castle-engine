PasGLTF along with dependencies (PasJSON and PasDblStrUtils)

By Benjamin 'BeRo' Rosseaux.

Original sources with examples:
  https://github.com/BeRo1985/pasgltf
  https://github.com/BeRo1985/pasjson
  https://github.com/BeRo1985/pasdblstrutils

We host a minimal copy of the PasGLTF and dependencies in this directory
as a convenience. This way you can compile Castle Game Engine with glTF 2.0
support out-of-the-box after cloning our repo.
(We don't even use GIT submodules, as many people are not familiar with them
and wouldn't do "git submodule update --init --recursive").

You *can* remove this directory and always use the original version from BeRo.
We do not want to modify or fork them here.
All the necessary modifications should be submitted back to BeRo repositories,
so that everyone benefits.
